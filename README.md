# Brazilian Sign Language recognition system through Artificial Neural Networks 
Summary - The difficulty in communication is one of the biggest
impediments to the daily lives of some People with Specials Needs. With this in mind, this project proposes the development
of a system for recognizing movements of the
Brazilian Sign Language (Libras). Therefore, it is necessary to
the use of a sensory glove specialized in capturing hand movement and Artificial Neural Network algorithms
 for their recognition. It was proposed to
identification of 19 static movements that make up the Libras alphabet. The acknowledgment
hand movement goes beyond social application and can be
used in robotics, augmented reality and virtual games.
